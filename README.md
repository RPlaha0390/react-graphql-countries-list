# Countries List (GraphQL and CRA)

Before you get into the code, why not take a look at the app in production:
[Example](https://counntries-list-graphql-react.netlify.app/)

Countries list is an front end app developed with `create-react-app --template typescript` and `graphql`.

This app queries a public API which can be found [here](https://countries-274616.ew.r.appspot.com/). The `response` of the request is used to display a list of countries.
